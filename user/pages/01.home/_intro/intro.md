# Interactive experiences bridging digital & physical

We help cultural organisations and brands to make their public presence tangible by connecting their digital activities to the tangible world around us. By creating physical and non-physical immersive experiences we make sure that your audience is an active participator of your event, exhibition, space, product or a library.
